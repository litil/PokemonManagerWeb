# MVP

The idea of this whole project is to play a bit with NodeJS by using an existing
API, build our own backend which will be used by a quite simple frontend.

The PokemongGo API I'm using here is the following one :

## QUICK TRANSFER

What's really annoying with the actual (Android) PokemonGo client is that you
have to scroll when seeing a pokemon details to see if it has strong attacks or
lame ones.

It would be nice to list all pokemons in our inventory with actual CP, stamina,
needed / available candies, attacks ... and has a direct button to transfer
them to the profesor.
